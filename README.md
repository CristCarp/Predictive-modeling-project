# Predictive modeling project - Predicting patient outcomes

## Overview
This project (presented in french) focuses on exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling using Python. Carried out in an academic context on real medical data, the aim of this work is to predict the probabilities of the patients dying, surviving, or surviving after a transplant. Nonetheless, the dataset has missing values, which undermines the predictive power of the model. 

Therefore, the attached notebook is structured of the following steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing values detection and treatment
- The presentation of the best performance
- All the tested methods (Random Forest, Boosting)

## Libraries employed
- pandas
- numpy
- missingno
- scikit-learn
