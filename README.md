# Predictive modeling project - Predicting patient outcomes

## Overview
This project (presented in french) focuses on exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling using Python. The main objective is the following: based on the patients' characteristics, we must predict the probabilities of them dying, surviving, or surviving after a transplant. Nonetheless, the dataset has missing values, which undermines the predictive power of the model. 

Therefore, the attached notebook is structured of the following steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing values detection and treatment
- The presentation of the best performance
- All the tested methods (Random Forest, Boosting)
